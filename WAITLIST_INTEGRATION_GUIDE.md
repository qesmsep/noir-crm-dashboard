# Waitlist-Integrated Membership Application System

## 🎯 Complete Workflow Overview

Your membership intake system has been integrated with your existing waitlist to create a secure, invitation-only application process. Here's how it works:

### 📋 User Journey

1. **Waitlist Submission** → User fills out initial waitlist form
2. **Admin Review** → Admin reviews and approves waitlist entries  
3. **SMS Invitation** → Approved users receive unique application link via SMS
4. **Application Process** → Users complete questionnaire, agreement, and payment
5. **Final Approval** → Admin reviews completed applications

---

## 🔄 Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Waitlist Entry
- **User Action**: Clicks "Request Membership Invitation" 
- **System**: Redirects to existing waitlist form
- **Data Stored**: Basic info (name, email, phone, company, etc.) in `waitlist` table
- **Status**: `review` (pending admin review)

### Phase 2: Admin Review & Approval  
- **Admin Action**: Reviews waitlist entries in Admin Dashboard → Waitlist tab
- **Admin Options**:
  - ✅ **Approve**: Ready for membership application
  - ⏸️ **Waitlist**: Keep on file for future consideration  
  - ❌ **Deny**: Permanently reject
- **Status Updates**: `approved`, `waitlisted`, or `denied`

### Phase 3: Application Link Generation
- **Admin Action**: Clicks "Send Link" for approved entries
- **System**: 
  - Generates secure, unique application token
  - Creates time-limited link (expires in 7 days)
  - Sends SMS to user's phone number
  - Updates status to `link_sent`

### Phase 4: Member Application
- **User Action**: Clicks SMS link to access application
- **System**: 
  - Validates token and loads pre-filled data
  - Tracks link opening (`application_link_opened_at`)
- **User Completes**: Questionnaire → Agreement → Payment
- **Data**: Linked to original waitlist entry via `waitlist_id`

### Phase 5: Final Processing
- **Status Tracking**: Full application lifecycle monitoring
- **Admin Review**: Final approval of completed applications
- **Member Creation**: Convert approved applications to members
