# Member Attributes & Balance Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive membership management features to the Noir CRM system, including automated monthly credit processing for Skyline members and enhanced campaign filtering capabilities.

## Database Changes

### 1. Members Table Additions
```sql
-- New columns added to members table (using existing 'membership' column)
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS monthly_credit DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 100.00;
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_credit_date DATE;
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS credit_renewal_date DATE;
```

**Note**: The `membership` column already exists in the members table and contains values like 'Skyline', 'Duo', 'Solo', 'Annual', etc.

### 2. Campaign Messages Table Additions
```sql
-- New column for membership type filtering
ALTER TABLE campaign_messages ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS membership_type_filter TEXT[];
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automated Monthly Credit Processing
- **Function**: `process_monthly_credits()` - Processes Skyline member renewals
- **Logic**: Hard reset to $100 each month based on join_date
- **Charging**: Automatically charges overspend amounts via Stripe
- **Scheduling**: Daily cron job at 7am CST to check for renewals

### 2. Stripe Integration
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/process-monthly-credits` - Handles credit processing and Stripe charges
- **Charging Time**: 8am CST for membership renewals
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for failed charges
- **Ledger Integration**: All charges/credits recorded in ledger table

### 3. Campaign Filtering
- **Membership Types**: Skyline, Duo, Solo, Annual
- **Special Filters**: all_members, primary_members
- **Implementation**: Updated campaign processing to filter by membership type
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing campaigns continue to work

### 4. Timezone Handling
- **Storage**: All dates stored in UTC
- **Display**: User-facing dates converted to CST
- **Processing**: Business logic runs in CST timezone

## Files Created/Modified

### Database Migrations
1. `add_membership_attributes_migration.sql` - Adds new member fields
2. `monthly_credit_processing_function.sql` - Database functions for credit processing
3. `add_membership_filter_to_campaigns.sql` - Adds campaign filtering

### API Endpoints
1. `src/pages/api/process-monthly-credits.ts` - Monthly credit processing with Stripe
2. `src/pages/api/process-campaign-messages-updated.ts` - Updated campaign processing

### Configuration
1. `vercel-cron-config.json` - Cron job configuration (7am daily)
2. `test_monthly_credits.js` - Test script for verification

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor
# 1. Add membership attributes
# 2. Create processing functions
# 3. Add campaign filtering
```

### Step 2: API Implementation
```bash
# Deploy API endpoints
# Configure environment variables
# Set up cron jobs
```

### Step 3: Testing
```bash
# Run test script
node test_monthly_credits.js
```

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ...

# Campaign Processing
CAMPAIGN_PROCESSING_TOKEN=your-secret-token
```

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Monthly Credit Processing
- **Skyline member with $20 balance**: Should add $80 credit
- **Skyline member with $150 balance**: Should charge $50
- **Skyline member with $100 balance**: No action needed
- **Non-Skyline member**: No processing

### 2. Campaign Filtering
- **Skyline-only campaign**: Only sends to Skyline members
- **All members campaign**: Sends to all members
- **Primary members campaign**: Only sends to primary members

### 3. Stripe Integration
- **Successful charge**: Creates payment intent and updates ledger
- **Failed charge**: Logs error and continues processing
- **No Stripe customer**: Skips charge and logs warning

## Monitoring & Logging

### Database Monitoring
```sql
-- Check Skyline members
SELECT member_id, first_name, last_name, membership_type, monthly_credit, last_credit_date, credit_renewal_date 
FROM members 
WHERE membership_type = 'Skyline';

-- Check recent ledger entries
SELECT * FROM ledger 
WHERE type IN ('credit', 'charge') 
AND date >= CURRENT_DATE 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### API Monitoring
- All processing logged with timestamps
- Error handling with detailed error messages
- Success/failure counts tracked

## Future Enhancements

### 1. UI Components
- Member management forms with membership type selection
- Balance display with credit information
- Campaign creation with membership type filters

### 2. Additional Features
- Manual credit adjustment interface
- Membership type change workflows
- Advanced reporting on credit usage

### 3. Integration Enhancements
- SMS notifications for credit adjustments
- Email notifications for failed charges
- Dashboard widgets for credit monitoring

## Security Considerations

### 1. Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- Stripe handles payment data securely
- Database access restricted to authorized services

### 2. Access Control
- API endpoints protected with authentication
- Database functions use service role for processing
- Cron jobs run with minimal required permissions

### 3. Error Handling
- Failed charges don't stop processing
- All errors logged for monitoring
- Graceful degradation for missing data

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Deploy API endpoints
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up Vercel cron jobs
- [ ] Test with sample data
- [ ] Monitor initial processing
- [ ] Update UI components (future)
- [ ] Train staff on new features

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Monitoring
- Daily: Check cron job execution
- Weekly: Review credit processing logs
- Monthly: Audit Stripe charges and ledger entries

### Troubleshooting
- Check Supabase logs for database errors
- Monitor Vercel function logs for API issues
- Verify Stripe webhook delivery
- Test with manual API calls if needed

This implementation provides a robust foundation for membership management while maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality.
