# Toast API Integration Status

## Current Implementation

### ✅ What's Working
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time transaction processing from Toast POS
- **Transaction Storage**: All Toast transactions are stored in `toast_transactions` table
- **Member Linking**: Transactions are automatically linked to members by phone number
- **Dashboard Display**: Toast revenue is shown in the dashboard using stored transactions
- **Sync Status Tracking**: All sync operations are logged and monitored

### ⚠️ Current Limitation
- **Sales Summary API**: The Toast API endpoint for sales summary reports is not yet configured
- **Real-time Revenue**: Currently using stored transactions instead of live API calls

## Toast API Setup Requirements

### 1. Toast API Access
To get real-time sales summary data, you need:
- **Toast API Key**: Access to Toast's API
- **Location ID**: Your specific Toast location identifier
- **API Endpoints**: Correct endpoints for sales summary reports

### 2. Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Toast API Configuration
TOAST_API_KEY=your_toast_api_key_here
TOAST_BASE_URL=https://api.toasttab.com/v1
TOAST_LOCATION_ID=your_location_id
```

### 3. API Endpoint Research Needed
The current implementation assumes these endpoints exist:
- `/reports/sales-summary` - Sales summary reports
- `/reports/daily-sales` - Daily sales data
- `/reports/monthly-sales` - Monthly sales data

**Note**: These endpoints may not exist or may have different names in Toast's actual API.

## Current Dashboard Behavior

### July Toast Revenue
- **Source**: Stored transactions in `toast_transactions` table
- **Calculation**: Sum of all transactions for the current month
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time as transactions are processed via webhooks
- **Accuracy**: Depends on webhook delivery and transaction processing

### Fallback Strategy
If Toast API is not available:
1. Use stored transactions from webhooks
2. Display note about data source
3. Continue to function normally

## Next Steps for Full Integration

### 1. Toast API Documentation
- Research official Toast API documentation
- Identify correct endpoints for sales summary reports
- Understand authentication methods

### 2. API Testing
- Test available endpoints with your Toast credentials
- Verify data format and response structure
- Implement proper error handling

### 3. Enhanced Integration
- Add real-time API calls for sales summary
- Implement caching for performance
- Add manual sync options

### 4. Alternative Approaches
If direct API access is not available:
- **Manual Export**: Export sales data from Toast POS manually
- **Scheduled Sync**: Set up automated data import
- **Webhook Enhancement**: Expand webhook data to include summary information

## Current Data Flow

```
Toast POS → Webhook → Store Transaction → Dashboard Display
     ↓
Stored Transactions → Financial Metrics → Dashboard Cards
```

## Testing Current Implementation

### Test Stored Transactions
```bash
node test-toast-sales-summary.js
```

### Test Financial Metrics
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/financial-metrics"
```

### Test Webhook Processing
```bash
node test-toast-integration.js
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Verify Toast API Access**: Check if you have API credentials
2. **Research Endpoints**: Find correct Toast API endpoints
3. **Test Current Data**: Verify stored transactions are accurate

### Long-term Goals
1. **Real-time Integration**: Connect directly to Toast API
2. **Enhanced Reporting**: Add detailed sales breakdowns
3. **Automated Sync**: Implement scheduled data synchronization

## Support

For questions about Toast API integration:
1. Check Toast's official API documentation
2. Contact Toast support for API access
3. Review current webhook implementation
4. Test with provided scripts

## Current Status: ✅ Functional with Stored Data

The dashboard is fully functional using stored Toast transactions. The Toast revenue calculation works correctly and updates in real-time as transactions are processed via webhooks.
