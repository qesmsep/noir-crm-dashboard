# Security Fix Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security fix for the Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) issues identified by the Supabase linter. The fix addresses all security concerns while maintaining application functionality.

## Security Issues Addressed

1. **Policy Exists RLS Disabled** - Tables with policies but RLS not enabled
2. **Security Definer View** - View with SECURITY DEFINER property
3. **RLS Disabled in Public** - Public tables without RLS enabled

## Affected Tables/Views

- `public.booking_window` - Booking window configuration table
- `public.messages` - Message storage table
- `public.settings` - Application settings table  
- `public.potential_members` - Potential member applications
- `public.reservation_reminder_templates_view` - View for reminder templates

## Files Created

### 1. `check-current-rls-state.sql`
**Purpose**: Diagnostic script to check current database state
**When to run**: Before applying fixes to understand current state
**Output**: Shows current RLS status and policies for affected tables

### 2. `backup_security_fix_20250131.sql`
**Purpose**: Creates backup of current security configuration
**When to run**: BEFORE applying the main security fix
**Creates**: Backup tables with current policies and states

### 3. `security_fix_comprehensive_20250131.sql`
**Purpose**: Main security fix that addresses all issues
**When to run**: AFTER running the backup script
**Actions**:
- Enables RLS on all affected tables
- Creates admin helper functions
- Drops existing policies and creates new admin-only policies
- Fixes security definer view
- Adds verification queries

### 4. `test_security_fix_20250131.sql`
**Purpose**: Verifies the security fix works correctly
**When to run**: AFTER applying the main security fix
**Tests**: RLS status, policy existence, view security, admin functions

### 5. `rollback_security_fix_20250131.sql`
**Purpose**: Reverts changes if issues arise
**When to run**: Only if problems occur after applying the fix
**Actions**: Restores original view and policies

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Check Current State
```sql
-- Run check-current-rls-state.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
-- This will show current RLS status and policies
```

### Step 2: Create Backup
```sql
-- Run backup_security_fix_20250131.sql
-- This creates backup tables with current configuration
```

### Step 3: Apply Security Fix
```sql
-- Run security_fix_comprehensive_20250131.sql
-- This applies all security fixes
```

### Step 4: Test the Fix
```sql
-- Run test_security_fix_20250131.sql
-- This verifies everything works correctly
```

### Step 5: Verify in Supabase Dashboard
- Check the Security section in Supabase Dashboard
- Verify no more security warnings appear
- Test application functionality

## Security Changes Made

### 1. RLS Policies

**Before**: Mixed or missing policies
**After**: Admin-only access for all affected tables

#### Booking Window Table
- ✅ Admins can view booking window
- ✅ Admins can update booking window
- ✅ Admins can insert booking window
- ✅ Admins can delete booking window

#### Messages Table
- ✅ Admins can view all messages
- ✅ Admins can create messages  
- ✅ Admins can update messages
- ✅ Admins can delete messages

#### Settings Table
- ✅ Admins can view settings
- ✅ Admins can update settings
- ✅ Admins can insert settings
- ✅ Admins can delete settings

#### Potential Members Table
- ✅ Admins can view all potential members
- ✅ Admins can create potential members
- ✅ Admins can update potential members
- ✅ Admins can delete potential members

### 2. View Security

**Before**: `reservation_reminder_templates_view` with SECURITY DEFINER
**After**: Regular view with RLS policies

### 3. Helper Functions

Created two helper functions for admin checks:
- `is_admin(user_uuid)` - Checks if user is an admin
- `is_super_admin(user_uuid)` - Checks if user is a super admin

## Access Control Summary

| Table/View | Access Level | Users |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| booking_window | Admin Only | Active admins only |
| messages | Admin Only | Active admins only |
| settings | Admin Only | Active admins only |
| potential_members | Admin Only | Active admins only |
| reservation_reminder_templates_view | Admin Only | Active admins only |

## Impact on Application

### ✅ What Still Works
- Admin dashboard functionality
- Booking window management
- Settings management
- Message management
- Potential member management
- Reservation reminder templates

### ⚠️ What Changed
- Only authenticated admins can access these tables
- Non-admin users cannot access sensitive data
- View no longer uses SECURITY DEFINER
- Booking window now requires admin authentication

### ❌ What Won't Work
- Non-authenticated access to these tables
- Non-admin access to sensitive data
- Direct table access without proper authentication
- Public access to booking window settings

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Permission denied" errors
**Solution**: Ensure user is authenticated and has admin role

### Issue: Application features not working
**Solution**: Check if user has proper admin permissions

### Issue: Need to revert changes
**Solution**: Run `rollback_security_fix_20250131.sql`

### Issue: Backup tables missing
**Solution**: Re-run `backup_security_fix_20250131.sql` before applying fix

## Verification Checklist

After applying the fix, verify:

- [ ] No security warnings in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] All admin features work correctly
- [ ] Non-admin users cannot access sensitive data
- [ ] Application functionality is preserved
- [ ] Backup tables were created successfully
- [ ] Test script shows all checks passing
- [ ] Booking window functionality works for admins

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is now properly protected
2. **Access Control**: Only authorized admins can access sensitive tables
3. **Compliance**: Meets Supabase security requirements
4. **Audit Trail**: All access is logged and controlled
5. **Future Proof**: Proper security foundation for future features

## Support

If issues arise after applying this fix:

1. Check the backup tables for original configuration
2. Run the test script to identify specific issues
3. Use the rollback script if necessary
4. Contact the development team with specific error messages

## Notes

- This fix maintains backward compatibility for admin users
- All existing data is preserved
- The fix is designed to be safe and reversible
- Future migrations should follow the same security patterns
- Booking window table now has proper admin-only access control
