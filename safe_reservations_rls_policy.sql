-- NOTES FOR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
-- =============================================================================

/*
IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. API ROUTES: All API routes should use SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to bypass RLS
   - This ensures the application can function properly
   - The service role key has full access to all data

2. FRONTEND: Frontend components should use NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - This respects RLS policies
   - Users will only see their own data

3. SECURITY LAYERS:
   - RLS provides database-level security
   - Application-level validation should also be implemented
   - API routes should validate user permissions before operations

4. NON-MEMBER RESERVATIONS:
   - Public can create non-member reservations
   - Application should implement additional validation for viewing/updating
   - Consider implementing a token-based system for non-member access

5. TESTING:
   - Test with both admin and non-admin users
   - Test member and non-member reservations
   - Test private event reservations
   - Verify that users can only access their own data

6. MONITORING:
   - Monitor for RLS policy violations
   - Log access attempts for security analysis
   - Consider implementing audit logging for sensitive operations
